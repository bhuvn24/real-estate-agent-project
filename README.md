# Real Estate Virtual Agent

A proof-of-concept multi-agent system that simulates a conversation with an intelligent real estate consultant. This application uses a 3D avatar, voice recognition, and a backend powered by specialized AI agents to recommend properties, negotiate prices, and send follow-ups.

## Features

-   **ü§ñ Multi-Agent System:** An orchestrator manages several specialized agents, each with a single responsibility:
    -   **Greeting Agent:** Uses Google's Gemini API for natural, conversational greetings.
    -   **Recommendation Agent:** Filters and suggests properties based on user preferences.
    -   **Emotion Agent:** Performs basic sentiment analysis to gauge user interest.
    -   **Negotiation Agent:** Adjusts property prices based on user interest and other factors.
    -   **Finance Agent:** Calculates loan and EMI options for a given property.
    -   **Follow-Up Agent:** Sends a summary via WhatsApp using the Twilio API.
-   **üó£Ô∏è Voice Interaction:** Leverages the browser's Web Speech API for both speech-to-text (user input) and text-to-speech (agent responses).
-   **üé® Interactive 3D Avatar:** A simple, interactive 3D avatar built with React Three Fiber provides a visual front for the agent.
-   **‚ö° Real-time Communication:** Uses WebSockets for low-latency communication between the frontend and the backend agents.
